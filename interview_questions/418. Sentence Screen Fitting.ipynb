    "### DP with Cycle Detection\n",
    "Cycle detection is the ultimate optimization for problems with repeating states. Here is how it works for this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Finite States\n",
    "In the DP approach, each row starts with a specific word index from the sentence. Since there are only `n` words in the sentence, there are only `n` possible \"starting states\" for any row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Pigeonhole Principle\n",
    "If you have $n$ words and you process more than $n$ rows, you **must** eventually start a row with a word index you have seen before. \n",
    "*   Example: Row 2 starts with word index `3`. Later, Row 10 also starts with word index `3`. \n",
    "*   This means Rows 2 through 9 form a **cycle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Jumping the Rows\n",
    "Once a cycle is detected, you know:\n",
    "*   **Cycle Length:** How many rows the cycle lasts (e.g., $10 - 2 = 8$ rows).\n",
    "*   **Cycle Gain:** How many full sentences were completed during those 8 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of simulating the next million rows one by one, you can use math:\n",
    "1.  **Remaining Rows:** `rem = total_rows - current_row`\n",
    "2.  **Number of Cycles:** `num_cycles = rem // cycle_length`\n",
    "3.  **Fast Forward:** `total_sentences += num_cycles * cycle_gain`\n",
    "4.  **Finish Up:** Simulate the few remaining rows (`rem % cycle_length`) manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this is powerful:\n",
    "With cycle detection, the `rows` loop effectively stops as soon as a repeat is found (at most after `n + 1` iterations). This turns the time complexity from $O(\\text{rows})$ into **$O(n \\times \\frac{\\text{cols}}{L})$**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If `rows` is **1 quadrillion ($10^{15}$)**, the String Transformation approach would take years to run, but the Cycle Detection approach would finish in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the idea of using the \"repeat\" to multiply the result make sense, or would you like to see a small numerical example?"
