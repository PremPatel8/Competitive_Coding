    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `0` representing an empty cell,\n",
    "    -   `1` representing a fresh orange, or\n",
    "    -   `2` representing a rotten orange.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return _the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange_. If _this is impossible, return_ `-1`.\n",

    "    Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]\n",
    "    Output: -1\n",
    "    Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.\n",

    "### Solution 1, BFS\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be more intuitive to visualize the rotting process with a graph data structure, where each node represents a cell and the edge between two nodes indicates that the given two cells are adjacent to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the top rotten orange, the contamination would propagate layer by layer (or level by level), until it reaches the farthest fresh oranges. The number of minutes that are elapsed would be equivalent to the number of levels in the graph that we traverse during the propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a delimiter (i.e. (row=-1, col=-1)) in the queue to separate cells on different levels. In this way, we only need one queue for the iteration. As an alternative, one can create a queue for each level and alternate between the queues, though technically the initialization and the assignment of each queue could consume some extra time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(M*N)\n",
    "  - First, we scan the grid to find the initial values for the queue, which would take O(NM) time.\n",
    "  - Then we run the BFS process on the queue, which in the worst case would enumerate all the cells in the grid once and only once. Therefore, it takes O(NM) time.\n",
    "  - Thus combining the above two steps, the overall time complexity would be O(NM)+O(NM)=O(NM)\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(M*N)\n",
    "  - In the worst case, the grid is filled with rotten oranges. As a result, the queue would be initialized with all the cells in the grid.\n",
    "  - By the way, normally for BFS, the main space complexity lies in the process rather than the initialization. For instance, for a BFS traversal in a tree, at any given moment, the queue would hold no more than 2 levels of tree nodes. Therefore, the space complexity of BFS traversal in a tree would depend on the width of the input tree."
