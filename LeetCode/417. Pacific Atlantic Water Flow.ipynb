    "## 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the **Pacific Ocean** and **Atlantic Ocean**. The **Pacific Ocean** touches the island's left and top edges, and the **Atlantic Ocean** touches the island's right and bottom edges.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the **height above sea level** of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is **less than or equal to** the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Return  *a **2D list** of grid coordinates* `result` *where* `result[i] = [ri, ci]` *denotes that rain water can flow from cell* `(ri, ci)` *to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans* .\n",

    "    **Output:** `[0, 4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]`\n",

    "    Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.\n",

    "### Solution 1, BFS\n",
    "If we start traversing from the ocean and flip the condition (check for higher height instead of lower height), then we know that every cell we visit during the traversal can flow into that ocean. Let's start a BFS traversal from every cell that is immediately beside the Pacific ocean, and figure out what cells can flow into the Pacific. Then, let's do the exact same thing with the Atlantic ocean. At the end, the cells that end up connected to both oceans will be our answer.\n",

    "- Time Complexity: O(M*N)\n",
    "  - In the worst case, such as a matrix where every value is equal, we would visit every cell twice. This is because we perform 2 traversals, and during each traversal, we visit each cell exactly once. There are M⋅N cells total, which gives us a time complexity of O(2⋅M⋅N)=O(M⋅N).\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(M*N)\n",
    "  - The extra space we use comes from our queues, and the sets we use to keep track of what cells have been visited.\n",
    "  - for a given ocean, the amount of space we will use scales linearly with the number of cells\n",
    "  - The same logic follows for the queues - we can't have more cells in the queue than there are cells in the matrix!"

So, if you prefer DFS, then that's perfectly fine for this problem. Additionally, it's possible that your interviewer will ask you to implement the problem recursively instead of iteratively. Recursion must be DFS, not BFS.\n",
