    "## 846. Hand of Straights\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `i<sup>th</sup>` card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3\n",
    "    Output: true\n",
    "    Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4\n",
    "    Output: false\n",
    "    Explanation: Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `1 <= hand.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`\n",
    "    -   `0 <= hand[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>`\n",
