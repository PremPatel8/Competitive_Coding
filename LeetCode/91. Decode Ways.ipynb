    "## 91. Decode Ways\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers. The message is **decoded** via the following mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `\"1\" -> 'A'   \"2\" -> 'B'   ...   \"25\" -> 'Y'   \"26\" -> 'Z'`\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes (`\"2\"` and `\"5\"` vs `\"25\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, `\"11106\"` can be decoded into:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `\"AAJF\"` with the grouping `(1, 1, 10, 6)`\n",
    "    -   `\"KJF\"` with the grouping `(11, 10, 6)`\n",
    "    -   The grouping `(1, 11, 06)` is invalid because `\"06\"` is not a valid code (only `\"6\"` is valid).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Given a string s containing only digits, return the **number of ways** to **decode** it. If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.\n",
