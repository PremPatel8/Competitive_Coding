    "## 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "  According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8\n",
    "  Output: 6\n",
    "  Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4\n",
    "  Output: 2\n",
    "  Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1\n",
    "  Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  -   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10<sup>5</sup>]`.\n",
    "  -   `-10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup>`\n",
    "  -   All `Node.val` are **unique**.\n",
    "  -   `p != q`\n",
    "  -   `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.\n",
