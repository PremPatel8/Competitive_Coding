    "## 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: A leaf is a node with no children.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\n",
    "    Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]\n",
    "    Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "    Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].\n",
    "        -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n",
