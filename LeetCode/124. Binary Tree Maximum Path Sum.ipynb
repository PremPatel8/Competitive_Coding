    "## 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",

    "### Solution 1, Post Order DFS\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where the path with the highest sum passes through the tree's root.\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be four scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The path starts at the root and goes down through the root's left child. We don't know how long the path is, but it could extend to the bottom of the left subtree.\n",
    "2. The path starts at the root and goes down through the root's right child. Very similar to the previous case, but the direction is toward the right.\n",
    "3. The path involves both the left and the right child.\n",
    "4. The path doesn't involve any child. The root itself is the only element of the path with maximum sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node can have negative or positive values. So a path sum contributed by a subtree could also be negative or positive. It would make sense to consider a path sum contributed by a subtree only if it is positive. If not, we can safely ignore it. In other words, the path goes down the left or the right subtree only if we see a gain in the path sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we must first determine the gain in the path sum contributed by the left and the right subtree. Once we have both, we decide whether to include their contribution. We can see that we need to process the children before we process a node. This indicates that we need to perform a post-order traversal of the tree because, in post-order, children are processed before the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the maz sum path does not go through the root node:\n",
    "Now, in addition to returning the path sum gain contributed by the subtree, the recursive function also keeps track of the maximum path sum. We update the maximum path sum whenever we find a new maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - Each node in the tree is visited only once. During a visit, we perform constant time operations, including two recursive calls and calculating the max path sum for the current node. So the time complexity is O(n).\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - the recursive call stack can go as deep as the tree's height. In the worst case, the tree is a linked list, so the height is n. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n)."
