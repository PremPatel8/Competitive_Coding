    "## 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]\n",
    "  Output: 7\n",
    "  Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :\n",
    "  |8 - 3| = 5\n",
    "  |3 - 7| = 4\n",
    "  |8 - 1| = 7\n",
    "  |10 - 13| = 3\n",
    "  Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]\n",
    "  Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "  Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "      The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5000].\n",
    "      0 <= Node.val <= 105\n",
