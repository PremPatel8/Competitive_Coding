    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.\n",

    "    Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"aba\"\n",

    "    Input: s = \"abca\"\n",

    "- Time Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - The main while loop we use can iterate up to N / 2 times, since each iteration represents a pair of characters. On any given iteration, we may find a mismatch and call checkPalindrome twice. checkPalindrome can also iterate up to N / 2 times, in the worst case where the first and last character of s do not match. Because we are only allowed up to one deletion, the algorithm only considers one mismatch. This means that checkPalindrome will never be called more than twice.\n",
    "  As such, we have a time complexity of O(N).\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "  - The only extra space used is by the two pointers i and j, which can be considered constant relative to the input size."
