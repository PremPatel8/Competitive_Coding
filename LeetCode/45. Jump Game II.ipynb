    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "  You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at index 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index (i + j) where:\n",
    "\n",
    "      0 <= j <= nums[i] and\n",
    "      i + j < n\n",
    "\n",
    "  Return the minimum number of jumps to reach index n - 1. The test cases are generated such that you can reach index n - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]\n",
    "  Output: 2\n",
    "  Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]\n",
    "  Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "      1 <= nums.length <= 104\n",
    "      0 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n",
    "      It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].\n",
