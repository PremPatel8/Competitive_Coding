    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:\n",
    "     \n",
    "    - Each child must have at least one candy.\n",
    "    - Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Return  *the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children* .\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    **Input:** ratings = [1,0,2]\n",
    "    **Output:** 5\n",
    "    **Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    **Input:** ratings = [1,2,2]\n",
    "    **Output:** 4\n",
    "    **Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.\n",
    "    The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "     \n",
    "    - `n == ratings.length`\n",
    "    - `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`\n",
    "    - `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`\n",
