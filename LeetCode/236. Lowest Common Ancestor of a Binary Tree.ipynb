    "## 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "    According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1\n",
    "    Output: 3\n",
    "    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",

    "    Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4\n",
    "    Output: 5\n",
    "    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2\n",
    "    Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10<sup>5</sup>]`.\n",
    "    -   `-10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup>`\n",
    "    -   All `Node.val` are **unique**.\n",
    "    -   `p != q`\n",
    "    -   `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.\n",
