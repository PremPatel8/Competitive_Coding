    "## 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given an `m x n` integers `matrix`, return  *the length of the longest increasing path in* `matrix`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You **may not** move **diagonally** or move **outside the boundary** (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Example 1:**\n",
    "  ![Image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/05/grid1.jpg)\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Input:** matrix = `[9, 9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]`\n",
    "  **Output:** 4\n",
    "  **Explanation:** The longest increasing path is `[1, 2, 6, 9]`.\n",

    "    DP Matrix: Uses a fixed-size 2D array (dp[rows][cols]).\n",
    "        Access: Direct indexing dp[r][c] is extremely fast (O(1)).\n",
    "        Memory: Allocates all memory upfront. Since every cell in the matrix will likely be visited, this is very efficient for \"dense\" grids.\n",
    "    DP Hash Map: Uses a dictionary (position_longest_path).\n",
    "        Access: Average O(1), but requires hashing the tuple (i, j) and handling potential collisions.\n",
    "        Memory: Grows dynamically. In Python, dictionaries have higher memory overhead per entry compared to a list of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "    In LeetCode environments, the Matrix approach is generally faster. Hashing a tuple (i, j) on every recursive call adds overhead that accumulates, especially for larger matrices (e.g., 200×200).\n",
    "    The Matrix approach also benefits from better cache locality, as the data is stored in contiguous blocks of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Case Suitability\n",
    "\n",
    "    Matrix: Best when the bounds are known and the \"state space\" is dense (i.e., you expect to fill most of the cache).\n",
    "    Hash Map: Useful if the coordinates were sparse or if the range of i and j was extremely large but only a few coordinates were actually reachable.\n"
