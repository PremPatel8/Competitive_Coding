    "## 1851. Minimum Interval to Include Each Query\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` describes the `ith` interval starting at `lefti` and ending at `righti` **(inclusive)**. The **size** of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally `righti- lefti+ 1`.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    You are also given an integer array `queries`. The answer to the `jth` query is the **size of the smallest interval** `i` such that `lefti<= queries[j] <= righti`. If no such interval exists, the answer is `-1`.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Return  *an array containing the answers to the queries* .\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    **Input:** intervals = `[1, 4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]`, queries = [2,3,4,5]\n",
    "    **Output:** [3,3,1,4]\n",
    "    **Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:\n",
    "    - Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.\n",
    "    - Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.\n",
    "    - Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.\n",
    "    - Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    **Input:** intervals = `[2, 3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]`, queries = [2,19,5,22]\n",
    "    **Output:** [2,-1,4,6]\n",
    "    **Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:\n",
    "    - Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.\n",
    "    - Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.\n",
    "    - Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.\n",
    "    - Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "     \n",
    "    - `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`\n",
    "    - `1 <= queries.length <= 105`\n",
    "    - `intervals[i].length == 2`\n",
    "    - `1 <= lefti<= righti<= 107`\n",
    "    - `1 <= queries[j] <= 107`\n",

    "\n",
    "\"offline queries\" means:\n",
    "We are allowed to process all queries in any order we choose (typically sorted), rather than answering them in the original given order one by one as they arrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online queries: You must answer each query immediately as it comes, without knowing future queries.\n",
    "Offline queries: You can see all queries in advance, so you can reorder them (e.g., sort by value) to make processing more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we sort queries by value (e.g., from smallest to largest), we can sweep through them while maintaining a dynamic set of \"active\" intervals using a min-heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This avoids checking all intervals for every query — leading to O((n + m) log n) instead of O(n·m).\n",
    "\n",
    "For N intervals and M queries:\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(nlogn + mlogm)\n",
    "  - Sorting intervals: O(n log n)\n",
    "  - Sorting queries: O(m log m)\n",
    "  - Each interval is pushed/popped from the heap once: O(n log n)\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(n+m)\n",
    "  - qidxs: stores m indexes -> O(m)\n",
    "  - result array stores m results -> O(m)\n",
    "  - Min-heap: in worst case, holds all n intervals -> O(n)"
