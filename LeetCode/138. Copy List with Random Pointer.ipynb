    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return the head of the copied linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:\n",
    "\n",
    "        val: an integer representing Node.val\n",
    "        random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.\n",

    "consider the linked list like a graph. Every node of the Linked List has 2 pointers (edges in a graph). Since, random pointers add the randomness to the structure we might visit the same node again leading to cycles. We need to take care of these cycles in the implementation. All we do in this approach is to just traverse the graph and clone it. Cloning essentially means creating a new node for every unseen node you encounter. The traversal part will happen recursively in a depth first manner.\n",

    "    \n",
    "4.  We then make two recursive calls, one using the `random` pointer and the other using `next` pointer. The diagram from step 1, shows `random` and `next` pointers in red and blue color respectively. Essentially we are making recursive calls for the children of the current node. In this implementation, the children are the nodes pointed by the `random` and the `next` pointers.\n",
