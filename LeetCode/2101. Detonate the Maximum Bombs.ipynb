    "## 2101. Detonate the Maximum Bombs\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given a list of bombs. The **range** of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a **circle** with the center as the location of the bomb.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  The bombs are represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `bombs` where `bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]`. `xi` and `yi` denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the `ith` bomb, whereas `ri` denotes the **radius** of its range.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  You may choose to detonate a **single** bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate **all bombs** that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  Given the list of `bombs`, return  *the **maximum** number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate **only one** bomb* .\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Example 1:**\n",
    "  ![Image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/06/desmos-eg-3.png)\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Input:** bombs = `[2, 1,3],[6,1,4]`\n",
    "  **Output:** 2\n",
    "  **Explanation:**\n",
    "  The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.\n",
    "  If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.\n",
    "  But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.\n",
    "  So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Example 2:**\n",
    "  ![Image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/06/desmos-eg-2.png)\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Input:** bombs = `[1, 1,5],[10,10,5]`\n",
    "  **Output:** 1Explanation:Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated is 1.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Example 3:**\n",
    "  ![Image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/07/desmos-eg1.png)\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Input:** bombs = `[1, 2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]`\n",
    "  **Output:** 5\n",
    "  **Explanation:**\n",
    "  The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because:\n",
    "  - Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0.\n",
    "  - Bomb 2 detonates bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2.\n",
    "  - Bomb 3 detonates bomb 4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3.\n",
    "  Thus all 5 bombs are detonated.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Constraints:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - `1 <= bombs.length <= 100`\n",
    "  - `bombs[i].length == 3`\n",
    "  - `1 <= xi, yi, ri<= 105`\n",
