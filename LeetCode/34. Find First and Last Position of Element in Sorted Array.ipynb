    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].\n",
    "\n",
    "    You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.\n",

    "Binary Search and Bidirectional Scan\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive way to use binary search to find the first and the last position of a target is to first determine the index of any occurrence of the given target. Suppose we know that the target is at the index i in the array. From there on, we do a linear scan to the left and keep going until we find the first occurrence of this target. Similarly, we do a linear scan to the right to find the last position. This works just fine. However, in the worst case when our entire array (or say 90% or more of it) is filled with the target, then this is a linear-time algorithm. In that case, the linear scan will end up taking more time than the binary-search itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Binary Searches\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a linear-scan approach to find the boundaries once the target has been found, let's use two binary searches to find the first and last position of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, we compare nums[mid] == target because we simply need to check if we found our target or not. But now, apart from checking for equality, we also need to check if mid is the first or the last index where the target occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "First position in the array\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two situations where an index will be the first occurrence of the target in the array.\n",
    "    1. If mid is the same as begin which implies our mid element is the first element in the remaining subarray.\n",
    "    2. The element to the left of this index is not less than the target that we are searching for. I.e. nums[mid - 1] < target. If this condition is not met, we should keep searching on the left side of the array for the first occurrence of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last position in the array\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two situations where an index will be the last occurrence of the target in the array.\n",
    "    1. If mid is the same as end which implies our mid element is the last element of the remaining subarray.\n",
    "    2. If the element to the right of mid is not greater than the target we are searching for. I.e. nums[mid + 1] > target. If this condition is not met, we should keep searching on the right side of the array for the last occurrence of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(logN)\n",
    "  - considering there are N elements in the array. This is because binary search takes logarithmic time to scan an array of N elements. Why? Because at each step we discard half of the array we are scanning and hence, we're done after a logarithmic number of steps. We simply perform binary search twice in this case.\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "  - since we only use space for a few variables and our result array, all of which require constant space."
