    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given a string `s`, rearrange the characters of `s` so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return _any possible rearrangement of_ `s` _or return_ `\"\"` _if not possible_.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: s = \"aab\"\n",
    "    Output: \"aba\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: s = \"aaab\"\n",
    "    Output: \"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `1 <= s.length <= 500`\n",
    "    -   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.\n",
