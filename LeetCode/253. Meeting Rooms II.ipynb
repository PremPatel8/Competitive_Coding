    "### Solution 1, Greedy Approach with Sorting and Min-Heap\n",
    "Solution description\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(NlogN)\n",
    "  - There are two major portions that take up time here. One is sorting of the array that takes O(NlogN) considering that the array consists of N elements.\n",
    "  - Then we have the min-heap. In the worst case, all N meetings will collide with each other. In any case we have N add operations on the heap. In the worst case we will have N extract-min operations as well. Overall complexity being (NlogN) since extract-min operation on a heap takes O(logN).\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - because we construct the min-heap and that can contain N elements in the worst case as described above in the time complexity section. Hence, the space complexity is O(N)."
