    "## 695. Max Area of Island\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\n",
    "    Output: 6\n",
    "    Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.\n",

    "    Output: 0\n",

    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `m == grid.length`\n",
    "    -   `n == grid[i].length`\n",
    "    -   `1 <= m, n <= 50`\n",
    "    -   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.\n",
