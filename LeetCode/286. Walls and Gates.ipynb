    "### Solution 1, BFS from the gates\n",
    "Instead of searching from an empty room to the gates, how about searching the other way round?  \n",
    "In other words, we initiate breadth-first search (BFS) from all gates at the same time.  \n",
    "Since BFS guarantees that we search all rooms of distance d before searching rooms of distance d + 1, the distance to an empty room must be the shortest.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think what some folks are missing in this second solution is that each gate is not fully searched before moving on to a new gate. Each gate only looks at the areas within 1 space before we check the next gate. So each area within one space of the gates are checked for rooms and these rooms are marked, then added to the queue. Once all gates are checked, each new space is checked, and so forth. So, once a room gets hit, it has to be from the closest gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(M*N)\n",
    "  - If you are having difficulty to derive the time complexity, start simple.\n",
    "  - Let us start with the case with only one gate. The breadth-first search takes at most m×n steps to reach all rooms, therefore the time complexity is O(mn). But what if you are doing breadth-first search from k gates?\n",
    "  - Once we set a room's distance, we are basically marking it as visited, which means each room is visited at most once. Therefore, the time complexity does not depend on the number of gates and is O(mn).\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(M*N)\n",
    "  - The space complexity depends on the queue's size. We insert at most m×n points into the queue."
