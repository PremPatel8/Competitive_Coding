    "## 678. Valid Parenthesis String\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given a string `s` containing only three types of characters: `'('`, `')'` and `'*'`, return `true`  *if*  `s`  *is **valid*** .\n",
    "   \n",
    "  The following rules define a **valid** string:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.\n",
    "  - Any right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.\n",
    "  - Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.\n",
    "  - `'*'` could be treated as a single right parenthesis `')'` or a single left parenthesis `'('` or an empty string `\"\"`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Example 1:**\n",
    "  **Input:** s = \"()\"\n",
    "  **Output:** true\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Example 2:**\n",
    "  **Input:** s = \"(*)\"\n",
    "  **Output:** true\n",

    "  **Example 3:**\n",
    "  **Input:** s = \"(*))\"\n",
    "  **Output:** true\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Constraints:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - `1 <= s.length <= 100`\n",
    "  - `s[i]` is `'('`, `')'` or `'*'`.\n",

    "### Solution 1, Greedy Two Stacks\n",
    "greedy strategy, prioritizing the use of open brackets over asterisks whenever possible to balance the right brackets. This ensures that we exhaust all available options for balancing before resorting to using asterisks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let n be the length of the input string.\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - The algorithm iterates through the entire string once, taking O(n) time. Additionally, in the worst case, it may need to traverse both the openBrackets and asterisks stacks simultaneously to check for balanced parentheses, which also takes O(n) time. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - The algorithm uses two stacks, openBrackets, and asterisks, which could potentially hold up to O(n) elements combined in the worst case. Additionally, there are a few extra variables and loop counters, which require constant space. Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n)."

    "- Time Complexity: O(N*N)\n",
    "  - The time complexity of the isValidString function can be analyzed by considering the number of unique subproblems that need to be solved. Since there are at most n⋅n unique subproblems (indexed by index and openCount), where n is the length of the input string, and each subproblem is computed only once (due to memoization), the time complexity is bounded by the number of unique subproblems. Therefore, the time complexity can be stated as O(n⋅n).\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(N*N)\n",
    "  - The space complexity of the algorithm is primarily determined by two factors: the auxiliary space used for memoization and the recursion stack space. The memoization table, denoted as memo, consumes O(n⋅n) space due to its size being proportional to the square of the length of the input string. Additionally, the recursion stack space can grow up to O(n) in the worst case, constrained by the length of the input string, as each recursive call may add a frame to the stack. Therefore, the overall space complexity is the sum of these two components, resulting in O(n⋅n)+O(n), which simplifies to O(n⋅n)."
