    "Time Complexity: O(N + E)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    N = number of nodes in the graph\n",
    "    E = number of edges in the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each node is visited exactly once — The self.visited dictionary ensures that when we encounter a node we've already cloned, we immediately return the cached clone without further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each edge is traversed twice — In an undirected graph, each edge appears in the neighbor lists of both its endpoints. When we process node A's neighbors, we traverse the edge A→B. Later, when processing node B's neighbors, we traverse B→A. However, the second traversal only triggers a dictionary lookup (O(1)), not a full recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Total operations: Visit N nodes + traverse 2E neighbor references = O(N + E)\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(N + E)\n",

    "Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "    self.visited dictionary: O(N)\n",
    "        Stores one entry per node (original → clone mapping)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Recursion call stack: O(N) (worst case)\n",
    "        In the worst case (e.g., a linear chain: 1→2→3→...→N), the recursion depth reaches N\n",
    "        In a more balanced graph structure, the depth would be less\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cloned graph structure: O(N + E)\n",
    "        N node objects\n",
    "        E edges represented in neighbor lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Total space: O(N) + O(N) + O(N + E) = O(N + E)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we separate algorithm overhead from output space, the algorithm uses O(N) auxiliary space (visited map + call stack), while the output itself requires O(N + E).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Why O(N + E) and Not O(N × E)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Great question! The key is understanding what operations are actually performed.\n",
    "The Fundamental Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "    O(N × E) would mean: \"For each of the N nodes, we traverse all E edges\"\n",
    "    O(N + E) means: \"We process N nodes in total, and traverse E edges in total\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Concrete Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 --- 2\n",
    "    |     |\n",
    "    4 --- 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    N = 4 nodes\n",
    "    E = 4 edges (undirected: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "What Actually Happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Visit node 1: Check 2 neighbors → 2 edge traversals\n",
    "    Visit node 2: Check 2 neighbors → 2 edge traversals (but nodes already visited, just dictionary lookup)\n",
    "    Visit node 3: Check 2 neighbors → 2 edge traversals (dictionary lookups)\n",
    "    Visit node 4: Check 2 neighbors → 2 edge traversals (dictionary lookups)\n",
    "\n",
    "Total operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    4 node creations (N)\n",
    "    8 neighbor checks (2E, since each edge appears in 2 neighbor lists)\n",
    "    = O(N + E) = O(4 + 4) = O(8)\n",
    "\n",
    "If it were O(N × E), we'd expect: 4 × 4 = 16 operations where each node somehow processes all edges, which doesn't happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N+E)\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - This space is occupied by the visited hash map and in addition to that, space would also be occupied by the recursion stack since we are adopting a recursive approach here. The space occupied by the recursion stack would be equal to O(H) where H is the height of the graph. Overall, the space complexity would be O(N). "
