    "## 973. K Closest Points to Origin\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `√(x1- x2)2+ (y1- y2)2`).\n",
    "   \n",
    "  You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Example 1:**\n",
    "  ![Image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/closestplane1.jpg)\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Input:** points = `[1, 3],[-2,2]`, k = 1\n",
    "  **Output:** `[-2, 2]`\n",
    "  **Explanation:**\n",
    "  The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).\n",
    "  The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).\n",
    "  Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.\n",
    "  We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just `[-2, 2]`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Example 2:**\n",
    "  **Input:** points = `[3, 3],[5,-1],[-2,4]`, k = 2\n",
    "  **Output:** `[3, 3],[-2,4]`\n",
    "  **Explanation:** The answer `[-2, 4],[3,3]` would also be accepted.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Constraints:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - `1 <= k <= points.length <= 104`\n",
    "  - `-104<= xi, yi<= 104`\n",
