    "\n",
    "    An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.\n",

    "### Solution 3, Union Find AKA Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to use this approach:\n",
    "Best for Dynamic Grids (where land is added over time)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the grid starts as all water and land is added one cell at a time. With BFS, you’d have to restart the whole search every time land is added. With Union-Find, you just perform a single union() operation with the new cell’s neighbors. It's much more efficient for real-time updates!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Only Two Directions: Notice we only check Right and Down. When you are iterating through every cell, checking \"forward\" is sufficient because the \"backward\" connections (Left and Up) were already handled when we were at those previous cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Initialization: The uf.count starts at the total number of land cells. Every time a union actually merges two separate islands into one, we decrement that count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Path Compression: In the find method, the line self.parent[i] = self.find(self.parent[i]) is the \"secret sauce.\" It flattens the tree structure every time it's called, making future lookups nearly instantaneous.\n",
    "\n",
    "### uf.union(r * cols + c, nr * cols + nc):\n",
    "Since the Union-Find parent array is a simple list like [0, 1, 2, 3, ...], it doesn't understand coordinates like (row,col). We have to give every cell a unique ID from 0 to (rows×cols)−1.\n",
    "To turn a 2D coordinate into a 1D index, we use:\n",
    "Index=(current_row×total_columns)+current_column\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a 3×4 grid (3 rows, 4 columns):\n",
    "\n",
    "|  | Col 0 | Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Row 0** | (0,0) | (0,1) | (0,2) | (0,3) |\n",
    "| **Row 1** | (1,0) | (1,1) | (1,2) | (1,3) |\n",
    "| **Row 2** | (2,0) | (2,1) | (2,2) | (2,3) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Export to Sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want the 1D index for the cell at **Row 1, Col 2**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We have already completed **1 full row** (Row 0).\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  Each row has **4 columns**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  So, 1 row×4 columns\\=4 cells passed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.  Now, add the current column index (2).\n",
    "    \n",
    "5.  **Result:** 4+2\\=6.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "If you count the cells starting from the top left (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...), the cell at (1, 2) is indeed the **6th** index!\n",
    "\n",
    "🔄 Can you go backwards?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! If you have the 1D index and want the 2D coordinates back, you use the modulo and division operators:\n",
    "row=index//cols\n",
    "col=index%cols\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do this 3D to 2D mapping\n",
    "Python handles 1D lists and 2D lists (lists of lists) very differently in memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1D List: A single contiguous block of memory. Accessing parent[i] is a single, lightning-fast pointer jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2D List: A \"list of pointers to other lists.\" To get to parent[r][c], Python has to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Find the outer list.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Follow a pointer to the r-th inner list.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Follow a pointer to the c-th element.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"double lookup\" adds overhead. In a problem like Number of Islands, where you might call find thousands of times, those extra nanoseconds add up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also a 2D array for parent and rank would make the code more verbose and complex\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use Path Compression (the trick where you point nodes directly to the root during a find), the \"Rank\" is no longer the literal height of the tree—it becomes an upper bound on the height. This is why it's called \"Rank\" instead of \"Height.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine two trees, Tree A and Tree B, both with a height (rank) of 2.\n",
