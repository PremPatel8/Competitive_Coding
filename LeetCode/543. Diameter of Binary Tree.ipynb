    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "  Output: 3\n",
    "  Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: root = [1,2]\n",
    "  Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "      The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n",
    "      -100 <= Node.val <= 100\n",

    "### Solution 1, DFS solution\n",
    "\n",
    "key observation:\n",
    "to make is: the longest path has to be between two leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can prove this with contradiction. Imagine that we have found the longest path, and it is not between two leaf nodes. We can extend that path by 1, by adding the child node of one of the end nodes (as at least one must have a child, given that they aren't both leaves). This contradicts the fact that our path is the longest path. Therefore, the longest path must be between two leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that in a tree, nodes are only connected with their parent node and 2 children. Therefore we know that the longest path in the tree would consist of a node, its longest left branch, and its longest right branch. So, our algorithm to solve this problem will find the node where the sum of its longest left and right branches is maximized. This would hint at us to apply Depth-first search (DFS) to count each node's branch lengths, because it would allow us to dive deep into the leaves first, and then start counting the edges upwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - This is because in our recursion function longestPath, we only enter and exit from each node once. We know this because each node is entered from its parent, and in a tree, nodes only have one parent.\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - The space complexity depends on the size of our implicit call stack during our DFS, which relates to the height of the tree. In the worst case, the tree is skewed so the height of the tree is O(N). If the tree is balanced, it'd be O(logN)."
