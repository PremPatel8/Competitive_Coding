    "## 543. Diameter of Binary Tree\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "  Output: 3\n",
    "  Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: root = [1,2]\n",
    "  Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "      The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n",
    "      -100 <= Node.val <= 100\n",
