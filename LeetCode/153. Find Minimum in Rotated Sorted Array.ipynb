    "## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.\n",
    "    -   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]\n",
    "    Output: 1\n",
    "    Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]\n",
    "    Output: 0\n",
    "    Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]\n",
    "    Output: 11\n",
    "    Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `n == nums.length`\n",
    "    -   `1 <= n <= 5000`\n",
    "    -   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`\n",
    "    -   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.\n",
    "    -   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.\n",

    "There is a point in the array at which you would notice a change. This is the point which would help us in this question. We call this the Inflection Point.\n",

    "#### The Key Insight\n",
    "The algorithm compares the middle element with the right element to determine which half of the array contains the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **In a rotated sorted array**, there's at most one \"break\" where a larger number is followed by a smaller number\n",
    "2.  **Comparing `nums[m]` with `nums[r]`** tells us which side contains that break\n",
    "3.  We keep **narrowing the search space** until `l == r`, which points to the minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Cases Handled Automatically\n",

    "**No rotation** (already sorted): `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Every iteration: `nums[m] < nums[r]` → keeps moving `r` left\n",
    "-   Converges to `l = r = 0` → returns `nums[0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single element**: `[5]`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `l = 0, r = 0` → loop doesn't run\n",
    "-   Returns `nums[0]` immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum at the end**: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Algorithm naturally converges to index 4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Logic Behind the Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 1: `nums[m] < nums[r]`\n",
    "```\n",
    "[... m ... r]\n",
    "     3  4  5    <- sorted portion\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The subarray from `m` to `r` is **sorted**\n",
    "- The minimum must be at `m` or to the **left** of `m`\n",
    "- **Action:** `r = m` (keep m as a candidate, search left)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 2: `nums[m] >= nums[r]`\n",
    "```\n",
    "[... m ... r]\n",
    "     7  0  1    <- rotation point is here\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler logic: Only one comparison per iteration\n",
    "Cleaner code: No edge case handling needed\n",
    "More elegant: Uses the invariant that the minimum is always in the unsorted half\n",
    "Safer loop condition: l < r prevents issues with index out of bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Time & Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Time: O(log n) - binary search\n",
    "Space: O(1) - only uses three variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this approach is that it avoids checking neighbors (which can cause index errors) and handles all cases with a single, elegant comparison!"
