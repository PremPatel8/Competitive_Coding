    "## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.\n",
    "    -   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You must write an algorithm that runs inÂ `O(log n) time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]\n",
    "    Output: 1\n",
    "    Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]\n",
    "    Output: 0\n",
    "    Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]\n",
    "    Output: 11\n",
    "    Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `n == nums.length`\n",
    "    -   `1 <= n <= 5000`\n",
    "    -   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`\n",
    "    -   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.\n",
    "    -   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.\n",
