    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11\n",
    "    Output: 3\n",
    "    Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: coins = [2], amount = 3\n",
    "    Output: -1\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: coins = [1], amount = 0\n",
    "    Output: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `1 <= coins.length <= 12`\n",
    "    -   `1 <= coins[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`\n",
    "    -   `0 <= amount <= 10<sup>4</sup>`\n",
