    "## 763. Partition Labels\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string `\"ababcc\"` can be partitioned into `[\"abab\", \"cc\"]`, but partitions such as `[\"aba\", \"bcc\"]` or `[\"ab\", \"ab\", \"cc\"]` are invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return _a list of integers representing the size of these parts_.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: s = \"ababcbacadefegdehijhklij\"\n",
    "    Output: [9,7,8]\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "    The partition is \"ababcbaca\", \"defegde\", \"hijhklij\".\n",
    "    This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.\n",
    "    A partition like \"ababcbacadefegde\", \"hijhklij\" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: s = \"eccbbbbdec\"\n",
    "    Output: [10]\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `1 <= s.length <= 500`\n",
    "    -   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.\n",

    "### Solution 1, Greedy Approach (extending partition boundaries as needed) with Last Occurrence Tracking using Two Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "Let n be the size of the input string s and k be the number of unique characters in s.\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - The algorithm iterates through the string twice. The first loop takes O(n) time to store the index of the last occurrence of each character in the lastOccurrence array. The second loop, also running in O(n) time, determines the partitions by tracking the end of each partition using the lastOccurrence array. Since both loops are linear and independent, the overall time complexity is O(n).\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(K)\n",
    "  - The algorithm uses a fixed-size array, lastOccurrence, of size 26 to store the last occurrence of each lowercase English letter. In the general case, the space required is proportional to the number of distinct letters in s. Thus, for an arbitrary alphabet (a set of distinct values) of size k, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(k).\n",
    "  - The partitionSizes array, which stores the lengths of the partitions, is part of the output and is not included in the space complexity analysis, since it is required by the problem statement."
