    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Return  *the number of combinations that make up that amount* . If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    **Input:** amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]\n",
    "    **Output:** 4\n",
    "    **Explanation:** there are four ways to make up the amount:\n",
    "    5=5\n",
    "    5=2+2+1\n",
    "    5=2+1+1+1\n",
    "    5=1+1+1+1+1\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    **Input:** amount = 3, coins = [2]\n",
    "    **Output:** 0\n",
    "    **Explanation:** the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    **Input:** amount = 10, coins = [10]\n",
    "    **Output:** 1\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "     \n",
    "    - `1 <= coins.length <= 300`\n",
    "    - `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`\n",
    "    - All the values of `coins` are **unique**.\n",

    "### Solution 1, Top Down DP\n",
    "For a specific coin, we have two options: either we take this coin and decrease the remaining amount we still need, or we ignore the coin and move to the next one without changing the remaining amount we still need. We add the number of ways to make up the required amount from both choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we may notice, we are breaking down a larger problem into smaller but similar problems, and adding the results of them to get the answer to the original problem. If we choose to take a coin with value, we are now searching for a combination of coins that sum up to amount - value. If we choose to skip the coin, we are still looking for a combination of coins that sum up to amount, but with fewer coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are breaking down a larger problem into smaller, similar problems, we can use recursion to implement this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let numberOfWays be the recursive method that we use to solve the problem. It would require two parameters: the index of the current coin under consideration i and the remaining amount needed. It would return the number of ways to make up the amount by only considering the coins beginning from index i.\n",
    "\n",
    "If amount equals 0, we return 1 as we can always make up the 0 amount by not taking any coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "If i equals n (where n is the number of coins), we return 0 as we don't have any more coins and hence can't possibly make up the amount. These two form the base cases of our recursive implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe that there are several repeating sub problems in recursion, To avoid this issue, we store the solution of each sub-problem and when we encounter the same subproblem again, we simply refer to the stored result. This is called memoization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know the current state of a sub-problem depends on the index of the current under consideration and the remaining amount, we can use a 2D array memo. memo[i][amount] stores the number of ways to make up amount using the coins beginning from index i.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here n is the size of coins:\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N * amount)\n",
    "    - We take O(n⋅amount) to initialize the memo array. There are total of O(n⋅amount) states that are computed. There is no loop inside the recursive method. Each state is computed once and it takes an average of O(1) time to compute the answer of a state using the smaller states. So, it takes O(n⋅amount) time to compute values for all the states.\n",
