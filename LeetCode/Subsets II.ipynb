    "- Time Complexity: O(N * 2^N)\n",
    "  - This approach does not generate any duplicate subsets. Thus, in the worst case (array consists of n distinct elements), the total number of recursive function calls will be 2n. Also, at each function call, a deep copy of the subset currentSubset generated so far is created and added to the subsets list. This will incur an additional O(n) time (as the maximum number of elements in the currentSubset will be n). So overall, the time complexity of this approach will be O(n⋅2n).\n",

    "  - The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the implementation of each programming language. Thus the use of inbuilt sort() function adds O(logn) to space complexity. The recursion call stack occupies at most O(n) space. The output list of subsets is not considered while analyzing space complexity. So, the space complexity of this approach is O(n)."

    "- Time Complexity: O(N * 2^N)\n",
    "  - At first, we need to sort the given array which adds O(nlogn) to the time complexity. Next, we use two for loops to create all possible subsets. In the worst case, i.e., with an array of n distinct integers, we will have a total of 2n subsets. Thus the two for loops will add O(2n) to time complexity. Also in the inner loop, we deep copy the previously generated subset before adding the current integer (to create a new subset). This in turn requires the time of order n as the maximum number of elements in the currentSubset will be at most n. Thus, the time complexity in the subset generation step using two loops is O(n⋅2n). Thereby, the overall time complexity is O(nlogn+n⋅2n) = O(n⋅(logn+2n)) ~ O(n⋅2n).\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(log N)\n",
    "  - The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the implementation of each programming language. For instance, in Java, the Arrays.sort() for primitives is implemented as a variant of quicksort algorithm whose space complexity is O(logn). In C++ sort() function provided by STL is a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Insertion Sort with the worst case space complexity of O(logn). Thus the use of inbuilt sort() function adds O(logn) to space complexity. The space required for the output list is not considered while analyzing space complexity. Thus the overall space complexity in Big O Notation is O(logn)."
