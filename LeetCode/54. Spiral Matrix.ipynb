    "### Solution 1, Mark Visited Elements\n",
    "If we mark the cells that we have visited, then when we run into a visited cell, we know we need to turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know which direction we need to turn to? Well, we are always following this loop: right, down, left, up, right again, and so on. Therefore, when we run into a cell that we have visited, we can simply turn to the next direction in the aforementioned loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the elements in the matrix are constrained to -100 <= matrix[row][col] <= 100\n",
    "therefore we can select a number that is out of this range to mark it as visited, such as 101\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Modifying the original data may not an option sometimes. In that case, we can also prepare another boolean matrix to store the cells we visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last puzzle piece is when shall we stop. An interesting observation is that if we reach the visited cell, we need to turn. However, when we meet another visited cell immediately after changing the direction, it means we reached the last element in the matrix. You'll see that an integer changeDirection is used to track the number of times we changed the direction consecutively.\n",
