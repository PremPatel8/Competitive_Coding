    "## 1143. Longest Common Subsequence\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, \"ace\" is a subsequence of \"abcde\".\n",
    "    A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: text1 = \"abcde\", text2 = \"ace\" \n",
    "    Output: 3  \n",
    "    Explanation: The longest common subsequence is \"ace\" and its length is 3.\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: text1 = \"abc\", text2 = \"abc\"\n",
    "    Output: 3\n",
    "    Explanation: The longest common subsequence is \"abc\" and its length is 3.\n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: text1 = \"abc\", text2 = \"def\"\n",
    "    Output: 0\n",
    "    Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000\n",
    "    text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.\n",
