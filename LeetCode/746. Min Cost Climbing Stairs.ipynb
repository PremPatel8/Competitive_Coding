    "## 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i<sup>th</sup>` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: cost = [10,15,20]\n",
    "    Output: 15\n",
    "    Explanation: You will start at index 1.\n",
    "    - Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.\n",
    "    The total cost is 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]\n",
    "    Output: 6\n",
    "    Explanation: You will start at index 0.\n",
    "    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.\n",
    "    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.\n",
    "    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.\n",
    "    - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.\n",
    "    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.\n",
    "    - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.\n",
    "    The total cost is 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`\n",
    "    -   `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`\n",
