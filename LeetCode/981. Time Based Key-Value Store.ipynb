    "## 981. Time Based Key-Value Store\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Implement the `TimeMap` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.\n",
    "    -   `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)` Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.\n",
    "    -   `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that `set` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns `\"\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input\n",
    "    [\"TimeMap\", \"set\", \"get\", \"get\", \"set\", \"get\", \"get\"]\n",
    "    [[], [\"foo\", \"bar\", 1], [\"foo\", 1], [\"foo\", 3], [\"foo\", \"bar2\", 4], [\"foo\", 4], [\"foo\", 5]]\n",
    "    Output\n",
    "    [null, null, \"bar\", \"bar\", null, \"bar2\", \"bar2\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Explanation\n",
    "    TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();\n",
    "    timeMap.set(\"foo\", \"bar\", 1);  // store the key \"foo\" and value \"bar\" along with timestamp = 1.\n",
    "    timeMap.get(\"foo\", 1);         // return \"bar\"\n",
    "    timeMap.get(\"foo\", 3);         // return \"bar\", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is \"bar\".\n",
    "    timeMap.set(\"foo\", \"bar2\", 4); // store the key \"foo\" and value \"bar2\" along with timestamp = 4.\n",
    "    timeMap.get(\"foo\", 4);         // return \"bar2\"\n",
    "    timeMap.get(\"foo\", 5);         // return \"bar2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100`\n",
    "    -   `key` and `value` consist of lowercase English letters and digits.\n",
    "    -   `1 <= timestamp <= 10<sup>7</sup>`\n",
    "    -   All the timestamps `timestamp` of `set` are strictly increasing.\n",
    "    -   At most `2 * 10<sup>5</sup>` calls will be made to `set` and `get`.\n",
