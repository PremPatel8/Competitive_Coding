    "## 692. Top K Frequent Words\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: words = [\"i\",\"love\",\"leetcode\",\"i\",\"love\",\"coding\"], k = 2\n",
    "  Output: [\"i\",\"love\"]\n",
    "  Explanation: \"i\" and \"love\" are the two most frequent words.\n",
    "  Note that \"i\" comes before \"love\" due to a lower alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: words = [\"the\",\"day\",\"is\",\"sunny\",\"the\",\"the\",\"the\",\"sunny\",\"is\",\"is\"], k = 4\n",
    "  Output: [\"the\",\"is\",\"sunny\",\"day\"]\n",
    "  Explanation: \"the\", \"is\", \"sunny\" and \"day\" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "      1 <= words.length <= 500\n",
    "      1 <= words[i].length <= 10\n",
    "      words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "      k is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]\n",
    "\n",
    "  Follow-up: Could you solve it in O(n log(k)) time and O(n) extra space?\n",
