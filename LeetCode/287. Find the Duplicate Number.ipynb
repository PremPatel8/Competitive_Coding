    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "      Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and using only constant extra space.\n",

    "    **Example 1:**\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]\n",

    "    **Follow up:**\n",

    "### Solution 2, Binary Search\n",
    "Consider an array that has n distinct numbers in the range [1,n]. For example: [1,2,3,4,5]. If we pick any one of these 5 numbers and count how many numbers are less than or equal to it, the answer will be equal to that number. So in [1,2,3,4,5], if you pick the number 4, there's exactly 4 numbers that are less than or equal to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when you have duplicates in the array, this count will exceed the number at some point. For example: in [4,3,4,5,2,4,1], 3 has 3 numbers less than or equal to it. However, the duplicate number will have a count of numbers less than or equal to itself, that is greater than itself (in this example, 4, which is the duplicate, has 6 numbers that are less than or equal to it). Hence, the smallest number that satisfies this property is the duplicate number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example: [4,6,4,2,1,4,3,5]. This has n+1 elements where n = 7. Take each number from 1 to 7 and count how many numbers are less than or equal to it. In our example, count(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) = (1,2,3,6,7,8,8). If we performed a linear scan, we would find that the number 4 is the first number to have its counts exceed the actual number (i.e. 6 > 4) - hence 4 is the duplicate\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, count is monotonic (it's values are always in non-decreasing order), and hence it is an excellent candidate for binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply a binary search with a goal of finding the smallest number that satisfies the aforementioned property. We start with a search space of [1,n] that has a midpoint mid. If mid satisfies the property, we narrow our search space to the left half [1,mid−1] and continue searching, otherwise, we narrow our search space to the right half [mid+1,n].\n",
    "\n",
    "To observe the monotonicity of count, consider the evaluation: \"For the given number, the count of numbers less than or equal to it, exceeds the number itself\". Going back to our example, we had derived: count(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) = (1,2,3,6,7,8,8). If we now take the first number and apply said evaluation, we get false (since count(1)==1, which is not greater than 1). Applying this evaluation to all counts, we get (false,false,false,true,true,true,true). Observe how this remains false in the beginning, and switches to true for the number 4 (i.e. the duplicate), after which point it remains true for all further numbers. Formally, the count for each number must include itself plus the count of all numbers less than itself. Since a number cannot have a negative count, each number, N, must have a count greater than or equal to the count of N-1. Since count(N)>=count(N−1), count must be monotonically increasing.\n",
