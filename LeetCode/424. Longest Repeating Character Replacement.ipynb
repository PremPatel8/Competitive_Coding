    "## 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "  You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Input: s = \"ABAB\", k = 2\n",
    "  Output: 4\n",
    "  Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Input: s = \"AABABBA\", k = 1\n",
    "  Output: 4\n",
    "  Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form \"AABBBBA\".\n",
    "  The substring \"BBBB\" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.\n",
    "  There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  -   `1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`\n",
    "  -   `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.\n",
    "  -   `0 <= k <= s.length`\n",

    "\n",
    "Time complexity: O(n)\n",
    "Space complexity: O(m) ~ O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where n is the length of the string and m is the total number of unique characters in the string, which for engligh alphabets is 26, so it is O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t reset or re-scan substrings like in the brute-force approach.\n",
    "Instead, you slide the window dynamically, always maintaining the valid range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: For any substring to be valid, the number of characters that need to be replaced equals:\n",
    "window_size - most_frequent_character_count\n",
    "If this value ≤ k, we can make all characters in the window the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, given a substring, we want to find out if it can be converted into a string with the same letters. Because we are allowed only k operations to do so, we would want to minimize the number of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can divide all the characters of the string s into two groups - fixed letters and the letters that will be changed. Fixed letters remain unchanged. The rest of the letters would be substituted by fixed letters. To keep the number of substitutions minimum, the number of fixed letters must be maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we find the character target, which occurs with the maximum frequency in the string. All other characters can now be replaced with target. If the count of other characters is less than or equal to k, then this substring fulfills the condition given in the question. We'd call it a valid substring."
