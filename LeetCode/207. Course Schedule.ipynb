    "\n",
    "If we regard each course as a node and draw an edge from bi​ to ai​ for any prerequisite [ai​, bi​] (to indicate that course bi​ should be completed before taking course ai​), we get a directed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a cycle in this directed graph, it suggests that we will not be able to finish all of the courses. Otherwise, we can perform a topological sort of the graph to determine the order in which all of the courses can be finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the problem is reduced to determining whether a cycle occurs in a graph. If there is a cycle, we must return false. If not, we return true.\n",
    "\n",
    "we can use Kahn's algorithm to get the topological ordering. Kahn’s algorithm works by keeping track of the number of incoming edges into each node (indegree). It works by repeatedly visiting the nodes with an indegree of zero and deleting all the edges associated with it leading to a decrement of indegree for the nodes whose incoming edges are deleted. This process continues until no elements with zero indegree can be found. The advantage of using Kahn's algorithm is that it also aids in the detection of graph cycles. If there is a cycle, the indegree of nodes in the cycle cannot be set to 0 due to cyclic dependency. We are unable to visit the cycle's nodes. So, if the number of visited nodes is less than the total number of nodes in the graph, we have a cycle.\n",

    "### Solution 2, Depth First Search with visit & inStack lists to detect cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use a depth-first search (DFS) traversal to detect a cycle in a directed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DFS, we use a recursive function to explore nodes as far as possible along each branch. Upon reaching the end of a branch, we backtrack to the previous node and continue exploring the next branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we encounter an unvisited node, we will take one of its neighbor nodes (if exists) as the next node on this branch. Recursively call the function to take the next node as the 'starting node' and solve the subproblem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node remains in the DFS recursion stack until all of its branches (all nodes in its subtree) have been explored. When we have examined all of a node's branches, i.e. visited all of the nodes in its subtree, the node is removed from the DFS recursive stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the graph has a cycle, we must have a back edge connecting a node to one of its ancestors while traversing nodes in the DFS manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, if a neighboring node is visited, it may or may not be an ancestor. If the neighboring node is an ancestor, i.e. there is a back edge, it means that we visited this ancestor node first in the DFS traversal, then visited and explored some other nodes, and eventually visited a node that connects back to the ancestor node. As we are still exploring the ancestor node's subtree while iterating over this path, hence this node must be in the current DFS recursive stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if a neighboring node is visited but not in the recursion stack, it signifies we have previously explored that node in a different branch, and it does not form a cycle in the current branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, to detect the cycle we must keep track of the visited nodes (like in a normal DFS) and also the nodes in the function's recursion call stack for DFS traversal. The nodes in the stack store the current path that we are on. There is a cycle in the graph if a node is reached that is already in the recursion stack. We use a boolean array of length n to track which nodes are in the call stack so we can check if a node exists in O(1).\n",
