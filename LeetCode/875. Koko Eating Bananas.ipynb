    "## 875. Koko Eating Bananas\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `i<sup>th</sup>` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return _the minimum integer_ `k` _such that she can eat all the bananas within_ `h` _hours_.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8\n",
    "    Output: 4\n",

    "    **Example 2:**\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5\n",

    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `1 <= piles.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`\n",

    "### Solution 1, Binary Search Approach\n",
    "If Koko can eat all the piles with a speed of n, she can also finish the task with the speed of n+1.\n",
    "With a larger eating speed, Koko will spend less or equal time on every pile. Thus, the overall time is guaranteed to be less than or equal to that of the speed n.\n",
    "If Koko can't finish with a speed of n, then she can't finish with the speed of nâˆ’1 either.\n",
    "With a smaller eating speed, Koko will spend more or equal time on every pile, thus the overall time will be greater than or equal to that of the speed n.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the current speed is workable, the minimum workable speed should be on its left inclusively. If the current speed is not workable, that is, too slow to finish the eating task, then the minimum workable speed should be on its right exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can use binary search to locate the boundary that separates workable speeds and unworkable speeds, to get the minimum workable speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N * log M)\n",
    "  - The initial search space is from 1 to m, it takes logm comparisons to reduce the search space to 1.\n",
    "  - For each eating speed middle, we traverse the array and calculate the overall time Koko spends, which takes O(n) for each traversal.\n",
