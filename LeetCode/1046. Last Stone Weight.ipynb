    "## 1046. Last Stone Weight\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `i<sup>th</sup>` stone.\n",
    "\n",
    "  We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the **heaviest two stones** and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  -   If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and\n",
    "  -   If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Return _the weight of the last remaining stone_. If there are no stones left, return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]\n",
    "  Output: 1\n",
    "  Explanation: \n",
    "  We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,\n",
    "  we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,\n",
    "  we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,\n",
    "  we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Input: stones = [1]\n",
    "  Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  -   `1 <= stones.length <= 30`\n",
    "  -   `1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`\n",
