    "## 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\n",
    "    Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: root = [1]\n",
    "    Output: [[1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: root = []\n",
    "    Output: []\n",
    "\n",
    "    Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].\n",

    "- Time Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - The algorithm performs a standard level-order traversal (BFS) of the tree, visiting each node exactly once.\n",
    "  - For each node, the basic operations (adding to queue, appending to temp list) take O(1) time.\n",
    "  - The only operation that might seem costly is temp.reverse(), but:\n",
    "    This is called once per level\n",
    "    Each level contains at most n nodes (in the extreme case of a completely unbalanced tree)\n",
    "    Python's list reverse operation is O(k) where k is the list length (number of nodes at that level)\n",
    "    Summing across all levels still gives us O(n) since each node appears in exactly one level\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - The queue can contain at most n/2 nodes (maximum number of nodes at the lowest level of a perfect binary tree) which is O(n)\n",
    "  - The result list ultimately stores all n values, making it O(n)\n",
    "  - The temp list stores at most the nodes at a single level, which in the worst case is n/2 for a perfect binary tree, making it O(n)\n",
    "  - Overall, the space requirement is O(n), dominated by the storage needed for the output and the queue during traversal."

    "The trick is that we append the nodes to be visited into a queue and we separate nodes of different levels with a sort of delimiter (e.g. an empty node). The delimiter marks the end of a level, as well as the beginning of a new level. For each level, we start from an empty deque container to hold all the values of the same level. Depending on the ordering of each level, i.e. either from left to right or from right to left, we decide at which end of the deque to add the new element\n",
