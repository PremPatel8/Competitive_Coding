    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Return `true` *if you can reach the last index, or* `false` *otherwise* .\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    **Input:** nums = [2,3,1,1,4]\n",
    "    **Output:** true\n",
    "    **Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    **Input:** nums = [3,2,1,0,4]\n",
    "    **Output:** false\n",
    "    **Explanation:** You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "     \n",
    "    - `1 <= nums.length <= 104`\n",
