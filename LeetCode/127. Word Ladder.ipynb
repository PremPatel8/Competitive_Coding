    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1-> s2-> ... -> sk` such that:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.\n",
    "  - Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.\n",
    "  - `sk== endWord`\n",
    "   \n",
    "  Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return  *the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from*  `beginWord`  *to*  `endWord` *, or* `0` *if no such sequence exists.*\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Example 1:**\n",
    "  **Input:** beginWord = \"hit\", endWord = \"cog\", wordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\",\"cog\"]\n",
    "  **Output:** 5\n",
    "  **Explanation:** One shortest transformation sequence is \"hit\" -> \"hot\" -> \"dot\" -> \"dog\" -> cog\", which is 5 words long.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Example 2:**\n",
    "  **Input:** beginWord = \"hit\", endWord = \"cog\", wordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\"]\n",
    "  **Output:** 0\n",
    "  **Explanation:** The endWord \"cog\" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  **Constraints:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`\n",
    "  - `endWord.length == beginWord.length`\n",
    "  - `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`\n",
    "  - `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`\n",
    "  - `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "  - `beginWord != endWord`\n",
    "  - All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.\n",

    "### Solution 1, BFS using a all_combo_dict hashmap with intermediate strings (h*t) as keys and words as values\n",

    "- Time Complexity: O(M2×N), \n",
    "\n",
    "        For each word in the word list, we iterate over its length to find all the intermediate words corresponding to it. Since the length of each word is M and we have N words, the total number of iterations the algorithm takes to create all_combo_dict is M×N. Additionally, forming each of the intermediate word takes O(M) time because of the substring operation used to create the new string. This adds up to a complexity of O(M2×N).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Breadth first search in the worst case might go to each of the N words. For each word, we need to examine M possible intermediate words/combinations. Notice, we have used the substring operation to find each of the combination. Thus, M combinations take O(M2) time. As a result, the time complexity of BFS traversal would also be O(M2×N).\n",

    "    Combining the above steps, the overall time complexity of this approach is O(M2×N).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(M2×N).  \n",
    "        Each word in the word list would have M intermediate combinations. To create the all_combo_dict dictionary we save an intermediate word as the key and its corresponding original words as the value. Note, for each of M intermediate words we save the original word of length M. This simply means, for every word we would need a space of M2 to save all the transformations corresponding to it. Thus, all_combo_dict would need a total space of O(M2×N).\n",
    "        Visited dictionary would need a space of O(M×N) as each word is of length M.\n",
    "        Queue for BFS in worst case would need a space for all O(N) words and this would also result in a space complexity of O(M×N).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Combining the above steps, the overall space complexity is O(M2×N) + O(M∗N) + O(M∗N) = O(M2×N) space.\n",
