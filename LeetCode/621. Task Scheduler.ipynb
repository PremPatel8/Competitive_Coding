    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number `n`. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of **at least** `n` intervals between two tasks with the same label.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return the **minimum** number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Input:** tasks = \\[\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"B\"\\], n = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Output:** 8\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.\n",
    "\n",
    "    After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3<sup>rd</sup> interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4<sup>th</sup> interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Input:** tasks = \\[\"A\",\"C\",\"A\",\"B\",\"D\",\"B\"\\], n = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Output:** 6\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.\n",
    "\n",
    "    With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Input:** tasks = \\[\"A\",\"A\",\"A\", \"B\",\"B\",\"B\"\\], n = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Output:** 10\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `1 <= tasks.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`\n",
    "    -   `tasks[i]` is an uppercase English letter.\n",
    "    -   `0 <= n <= 100`\n",

    "### Solution 1, Greedy Approach Using Math Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Key Idea: Schedule the Most Frequent Task First\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the most frequent task (say `'A'`) appears `max_val` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To respect the cooldown `n`, you need **at least `n` other tasks or idle slots** between two `'A'`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you can think of building a **framework** like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A _ _ _ A _ _ _ A _ _ _ A        ← if max_val = 4, n = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "-   There are `max_val - 1` **gaps** (or \"parts\") between the `A`s.\n",
    "-   Each gap must be **at least `n` slots long** → so each block (including the `A`) is `n + 1` units:\n",
    "    -   `[A _ _ _] [A _ _ _] [A _ _ _] A`\n",
    "-   The last `A` doesn’t need a cooldown after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the **skeleton** takes:\n",
    "(max_val - 1) * (n + 1) slots\n",
    "Then add the final A → but wait! What if multiple tasks tie for max_val?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Handling Ties: `max_count`\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose both `'A'` and `'B'` appear `max_val = 4` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then your schedule must end with **all** of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A B _ _ A B _ _ A B _ _ A B\n",
    "```\n",
    "So the last block has **`max_count` tasks**, not just 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, total length becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `(max_val - 1) * (n + 1) + max_count`\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This accounts for:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `max_val - 1` full cycles (each of size `n + 1`)\n",
    "-   Plus `max_count` tasks at the end (all the most frequent ones)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚖️ But What If There Are Enough Other Tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have **so many other tasks** that they **fill all idle slots**, then you don’t need any idles — total time is just `len(tasks)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "Tasks = `[\"A\",\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"C\",\"C\"]`, `n = 1`  \n",
    "→ You can do: `A B C A B C` → no idles needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So final answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "max(len(tasks), (max_val - 1) * (n + 1) + max_count)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let N be the number of tasks.\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "  - The loop iterating over the tasks array has a time complexity of O(N). The loop iterating over the freq array has a time complexity proportional to the number of unique tasks, which is at most 26 because the tasks are represented by the letters A to Z. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N+26), which simplifies to O(N).\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(26) = O(1)\n",
    "  - The freq array can store at most 26 unique tasks, resulting in O(26) space complexity. Other variables used in the algorithm have constant space requirements. Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(1)."
