    "## 1648. Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls of **any** color.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls **of that color **you currently have in your `inventory`. For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).\n",
    "     \n",
    "    You are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `ith` color that you initially own. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls **in any order**.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Return  *the **maximum** total value that you can attain after selling* `orders` *colored balls* . As the answer may be too large, return it **modulo **`109+ 7`.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    ![Image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/jj.gif)\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Input:** inventory = [2,5], orders = 4\n",
    "    **Output:** 14\n",
    "    **Explanation:** Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).\n",
    "    The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    **Input:** inventory = [3,5], orders = 6\n",
    "    **Output:** 19\n",
    "    **Explanation: **Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).\n",
    "    The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "     \n",
    "    - `1 <= inventory.length <= 105`\n",
    "    - `1 <= inventory[i] <= 109`\n",
    "    - `1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 109)`\n",
