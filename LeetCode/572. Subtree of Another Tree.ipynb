    "## 572. Subtree of Another Tree\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",

    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The number of nodes in the `root` tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.\n",
    "    -   The number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.\n",
    "    -   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= root.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>`\n",

After calling isIdentical, it will be back to at most O(N) since all elements made by isIdentical are popped out. Hence, the maximum number of elements in the call stack will be M+N."
