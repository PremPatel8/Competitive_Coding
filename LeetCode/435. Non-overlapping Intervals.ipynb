    "## 435. Non-overlapping Intervals\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return  *the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping* .\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Note** that intervals which only touch at a point are **non-overlapping**. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    **Input:** intervals = `[1, 2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]`\n",
    "    **Output:** 1\n",
    "    **Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    **Input:** intervals = `[1, 2],[1,2],[1,2]`\n",
    "    **Output:** 2\n",
    "    **Explanation:** You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    **Input:** intervals = `[1, 2],[2,3]`\n",
    "    **Output:** 0\n",
    "    **Explanation:** You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "     \n",
    "    - `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`\n",
    "    - `intervals[i].length == 2`\n",
    "    - `-5 * 104<= starti< endi<= 5 * 104`\n",
