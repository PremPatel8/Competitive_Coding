    "## 198. House Robber\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]\n",
    "    Output: 4\n",
    "    Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).\n",
    "    Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]\n",
    "    Output: 12\n",
    "    Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).\n",
    "    Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`\n",
    "    -   `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`\n",

    "\n",
    "The recursive approach may run into trouble when the recursion stack grows too large. It may also run into trouble because, for each recursive call, the compiler must do additional work to maintain the call stack (function variables, etc.) which results in unwanted overhead. The dynamic programming approach is simply a tabular formulation of the ideas presented above.\n",

    "  - which is used by the table. So what is the real advantage of this solution over the previous solution? In this case, we don't have a recursion stack. When the number of houses is large, a recursion stack can become a serious limitation, because the recursion stack size will be huge and the compiler will eventually run into stack-overflow problems"
