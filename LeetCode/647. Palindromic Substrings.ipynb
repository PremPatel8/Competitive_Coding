    "## 647. Palindromic Substrings\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    Given a string `s`, return _the number of **palindromic substrings** in it_.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A string is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: s = \"abc\"\n",
    "    Output: 3\n",
    "    Explanation: Three palindromic strings: \"a\", \"b\", \"c\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Input: s = \"aaa\"\n",
    "    Output: 6\n",
    "    Explanation: Six palindromic strings: \"a\", \"a\", \"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\", \"aaa\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`\n",
    "    -   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.\n",

    "### Solution 1, Expand From Centers\n",
    "A palindrome mirrors around its center. So, for each possible center in the string, expand outward as long as the characters on both sides match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Odd-length palindromes have a single character as the center (e.g., \"aba\" → center at 'b').\n",
    "    Even-length palindromes have two characters as the center (e.g., \"abba\" → center between the two 'b's).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for a string of length n, there are 2n - 1 possible centers:\n",
    "\n",
    "    n centers for odd-length palindromes (each character)\n",
    "    n - 1 centers for even-length palindromes (between each pair of adjacent characters)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N^2)\n",
    "  - There are 2n−1=O(n) centers. For each center, we call expand, which costs up to O(n).\n",
    "  - Although the time complexity is the same as in the DP approach, the average/practical runtime of the algorithm is much faster. This is because most centers will not produce long palindromes, so most of the O(n) calls to expand will cost far less than n iterations.\n",
    "  - The worst case scenario is when every character in the string is the same.\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "  - We don't use any extra space other than a few integers. This is a big improvement on the DP approach."
