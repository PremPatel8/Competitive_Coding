    "## 71. Simplify Path\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "  <blockquote>\n",
    "    You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "        A single period '.' represents the current directory.\n",
    "        A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.\n",
    "        Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.\n",
    "        Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The path must start with a single slash '/'.\n",
    "        Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.\n",
    "        The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.\n",
    "        The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return the simplified canonical path.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: path = \"/home/\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Output: \"/home\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The trailing slash should be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: path = \"/home//foo/\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Output: \"/home/foo\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: path = \"/home/user/Documents/../Pictures\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Output: \"/home/user/Pictures\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A double period \"..\" refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: path = \"/../\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Output: \"/\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: path = \"/.../a/../b/c/../d/./\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Output: \"/.../b/d\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"...\" is a valid name for a directory in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1 <= path.length <= 3000\n",
    "        path consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.\n",
    "        path is a valid absolute Unix path.\n",
